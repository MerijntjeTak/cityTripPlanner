# Example address list file
# The address doesn't have to be an actual 'address'. It could be anything
#  that Google Maps recognizes as a single place on earth. If multiple 
#  addresses are found using your string, the first one will be picked as
#  the location for the marker
#
#  Format:
#   Name ; Address ; Category
#   (colons can be used instead of semicolons if the acceptColons option 
#    in the script is set to true)
