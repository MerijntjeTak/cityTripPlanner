#    cityTripPlanner.pl - Convert a list of addresses to a bunch of Google Maps markers 
#
#    This script lets you create a KML marker list for use in Google
#     maps based on a list of addresses. The script converts the
#     addresses to coordinates by using the Google Maps Geocoder API, and
#     then creates an XML file with the coordinates for viewing on Google
#     Maps.
#
#    You can put PoI's (Points of Interest) in categories and attach
#    different color markers to those categories, for easy viewing. The
#    Google Maps WUI also combines the categories for easy viewing.
#
#    Usage:
#     1. Configure the variables in the script (xmlName, xmlDesc,
#       addressList, outputXml)
#
#     2. Modify the addressList.txt file
#       The file is a 'semicolon'-seperated file, the fields are:
#        Name of PoI;Address of PoI;Category of PoI
#
#     3. Run the script
#
#     4. Put the output XML on a web-accessible location, and enter the
#     URI in the search field in Google Maps (yeah, that actually
#     works!). Please note that the XML location has to be accessible
#     from the web, as the Google server will fetch the XML (instead of
#     the usual Javasript behaviour of letting the browser do the work).
#
#     Obviously you can also use the XML together with your Google Maps
#     API 'iframe', or other KML enabled applications.
#     
#     Dependencies:
#      - Perl module LWP::Simple
#      - Perl module JSON
#
#     Note on categories:
#     The categories are just a string, which is used in both the
#      addressList and the scripts configuration variables. It is
#      necessary that those strings exactly match! 
#      In the scripts configuration you can see that the actual marker
#      icon used by Google maps is just an image. The standard images are
#      provided by the Google toolkit, but you can just was well replace
#      them with your own.
#
#     Note on updating the map:
#     If you update the KML file, it could be that you see no change.
#      That is because Google caches the fetch of the KML file at your
#      webserver for a few minutes. A possible workaround is to rename
#      the XML, create symlinks or use the Google Maps API create a map
#      yourself (based on JavaScript, where the markers will be generated
#      by your browser).
#
#     Another thing to keep in mind is that if you put the XML URI in
#      the Google Maps search box, Google will actually render the map
#      images with the markers built in! This means that your browser
#      will cache the map images including the markers (so it seems the
#      map isn't updating). If you experience this problem you can clear
#      your browser cache (Firefox: Tools->Clear recent
#      history->Details->Cache), or use the Google Maps API to render
#      your own map (as described above).
#
#    An example Google Maps API JavaScript page is on the roadmap.
#
#    FAQ
#    - My markers don't show up!
#     Please check the following things:
#     - Did you run the script after changing the addressList file? (it happens)
#     - Did you let the Google server cache expire?
#     - Did you clear your browser cache?
#     - Did you use colons in the addressList even though the allowColons
#      variable is set to 0?
